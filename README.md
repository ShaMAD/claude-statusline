# claude-statusline

Configure your Claude Code statusline to show limits, directory and git info

![demo](./.github/demo.png)

## Install

Run the command below to set it up

```bash
npx @kamranahmedse/claude-statusline
```

It backups your old status line if any and copies the status line script to `~/.claude/statusline.sh` and configures your Claude Code settings.

On Linux it also shows a `cpu` / `mem` line with the load of the whole machine, read from `/proc`. CPU is averaged between two refreshes, so it shows `—` on the first one; swap is added when 10% or more is in use. On macOS the line is hidden.

## Requirements

- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — for parsing JSON
- curl — for fetching rate limit data
- git — for branch info

On macOS:

```bash
brew install jq
```

## Uninstall

```bash
npx @kamranahmedse/claude-statusline --uninstall
```

If you had a previous statusline, it restores it from the backup. Otherwise it removes the script and cleans up your settings.
